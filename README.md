# HoELearn - LMS Mobile Application

A modern Learning Management System (LMS) mobile application built with Expo, React Native, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Expo Router.

## Overview

HoELearn allows users to discover courses, bookmark content, enroll in courses, view course details, access learning content through WebView, and manage their profile. The application demonstrates modern mobile development practices including authentication, state management, API integration, offline awareness, local persistence, and native device capabilities.
